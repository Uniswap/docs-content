# Authentication

All API requests require authentication using an API key. This guide covers how to obtain and use your API key.

## Getting an API Key

1. Sign in to the [Developer Portal](/)
2. Navigate to your dashboard
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy and securely store your key

<Callout type="warning">
  Your API key is shown only once when created. Store it securely as you won't be able to view it again.
</Callout>

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of all requests:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.uniswap.org/v1/endpoint" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Security Best Practices

<Steps>
### Never expose your API key in client-side code

API keys should only be used in server-side code. Exposing them in frontend applications allows anyone to use your key.

### Use environment variables

Store your API key in environment variables rather than hardcoding it:

```typescript
const apiKey = process.env.UNISWAP_API_KEY
```

### Rotate keys regularly

For enhanced security, rotate your API keys periodically. You can create a new key and deprecate the old one in the Developer Portal.

### Monitor usage

Keep an eye on your API usage in the Developer Portal to detect any unusual activity.
</Steps>

## Rate Limits

API keys have rate limits based on your plan:

| Plan | Requests per minute | Requests per day |
|------|---------------------|------------------|
| Free | 100 | 10,000 |
| Pro | 1,000 | 100,000 |
| Enterprise | Custom | Custom |

If you exceed your rate limits, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

## What is Unichain?
Unichain is revolutionizing DeFi by developing the fastest, most cost-effective Layer 2 network for cross-chain liquidity. Built to unite fragmented blockchain ecosystems, it's where traders, developers, and liquidity providers come together to access seamless, efficient markets.

### Stage 1 Rollup
Unichain is the first Ethereum L2 to launch as a Stage 1 Rollup with a fully functioning permissionless fault proof system ensuring the trustless security of the network.

### Instant transactions
Unichain will launch with 1-second block times, with 200 ms block times coming soon. Reducing latency significantly improves market efficiency by increasing the frequency of arbitrage and lowering value lost to MEV.

### Reduced cost and further decentralization
Unichain is designed to leverage and accelerate Ethereum's scaling roadmap, moving execution to an L2. This lowers transaction costs by ~95% in the short term, and even more over time. While Unichain relies on a single sequencer for efficiency, it introduces further decentralization by allowing full nodes to help verify blocks.

### Cross-chain liquidity
Unichain is built to support seamless transactions across dozens of chains, making it easy to access liquidity no matter what chain users are on. As part of the Superchain, Unichain will support native [interoperability](https://docs.optimism.io/get-started/interop), and Uniswap Labs will continue pioneering standards for seamless interoperability across all chains.

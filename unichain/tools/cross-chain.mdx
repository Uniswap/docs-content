description: Cross-chain messaging protocols that support Unichain
---

## LayerZero

[LayerZero](https://layerzero.network/) is an omnichain interoperability protocol that enables cross-chain messaging. Applications built on Unichain can use the LayerZero protocol to connect to 80+ supported blockchains seamlessly.

To get started with integrating LayerZero, visit the [documentation](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2) and provided examples on [GitHub](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/devtools/tree/main/examples).

### Supported Networks

- Unichain Mainnet
- Unichain Sepolia Testnet

## Wormhole

[Wormhole](https://wormhole.com/) is the leading interoperability platform powering multichain applications and bridges at scale.
The core primitive is a generic message-passing protocol that enables secure and efficient communication between blockchains.

To get started with integrating Wormhole, visit the [documentation](https://docs.wormhole.com/wormhole/) and provided [example implementations](https://wormhole.com/docs/tutorials/).

### Supported Networks
- Unichain Mainnet
- Unichain Sepolia Testnet

## Stargate

[Stargate](https://stargate.finance/) is a liquidity network powering omnichain DeFi, offering a secure bridge for the transfer of value across chains.

For more information on integrating Stargate, visit their [documentation](https://stargateprotocol.gitbook.io/stargate/v2-user-docs).

### Supported Networks
- Unichain Mainnet
- Unichain Sepolia Testnet

## Hyperlane

[Hyperlane](https://hyperlane.xyz) is the open framework for interoperability, a permissionless protocol for cross-chain communication. It enables message passing and asset transfers across different chains without any gatekeeping, or dependency on a central organization.

To get started with integrating Hyperlane, visit the [documentation](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/) and explore the configuration for [Unichain Mainnet](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-registry/tree/main/chains/unichain) and [Unichain Testnet](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-registry/tree/main/chains/unichaintestnet) on GitHub.

### Supported Networks

- Unichain Mainnet
- Unichain Sepolia Testnet


## Polymer

[Polymer](https://www.polymerlabs.org) is a rollup purpose-built for interoperability between rollups, removing the need for cross-chain messaging. Anyone can execute and verify actions across any chain in real-time, the fastest latency available.

To get started with Polymer, please visit their [documentation](https://docs.polymerlabs.org/docs/build/interop-contract/) and [example implmentations](https://docs.polymerlabs.org/docs/category/examples-1).

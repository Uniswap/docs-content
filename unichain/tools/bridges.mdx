## Relay

[Relay](https://relay.link/bridge/base?fromChainId=130) is a cross-chain payments system that enables fast, affordable bridging and cross-chain execution by connecting users with relayers—financial agents that act on users' behalfs across chains for a small fee. It minimizes gas costs and execution latency, making it ideal for payments, bridging, NFT minting, and gas abstraction.

## GhostGraph

[GhostGraph](https://GhostGraph.xyz/) makes it easy to build blazingly fast indexers (subgraphs) for smart contracts.

GhostGraph is the first indexing solution that lets you write your index transformations in **Solidity**. Unichain dApps can query data with GraphQL using our hosted endpoints.

To get started, you can [sign up for an account](https://app.ghostlogs.xyz/ghostgraph/sign-up) and follow [this quickstart](https://docs.ghostlogs.xyz/category/-getting-started-1) guide on how to create, deploy, and query a GhostGraph.

## SQD

[SQD Network](https://docs.sqd.dev/subsquid-network/overview/) is a decentralized query engine optimized for batch extraction of large volumes of data.
It currently serves historical on-chain data ingested from 100+ EVM chains, including Unichain Sepolia.

The indexing service provides EVM event logs, transaction receipts, traces, and per-transaction state diffs.

To get started, visit the [EVM API](https://docs.sqd.dev/subsquid-network/reference/evm-api/) or see the [Squid Typescript SDK](https://docs.sqd.dev/sdk/quickstart/)

## The Graph

[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) makes it easy to organize and access onchain data.

The Graph is the original decentralized data marketplace that invented and standardized Subgraphs, which are open APIs you can query to rapidly serve data into your Unichain application's frontend. With The Graph, you can build serverless applications that run entirely on public infrastructure.

To get started, visit the [documentation](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/) or see [this quickstart](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/cookbook/quick-start/) on how to create, deploy, and query a subgraph that organizes Unichain data.

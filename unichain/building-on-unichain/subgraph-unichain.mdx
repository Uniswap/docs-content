title: Building a Subgraph
description: Learn how to build a subgraph to query Unichain data
---

Getting historical data on smart contracts can be frustrating when building a dapp. With [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) anyone can create or query subgraphs, making the data available to the entire ecosystem.

## Quickstart

A subgraph can be created in just a few minutes by following these steps:

1. Initialize your subgraph
2. Publish your subgraph to The Graph Network
3. Query from your dapp with your unique API key

## Step 1: Initialize Your Subgraph

### Create a Subgraph in Subgraph Studio

Go to the [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/) and connect your
wallet. Once your wallet is connected, you can begin by clicking "Create a
Subgraph". When choosing a name, it's recommended to use Title Case, including
the subgraph and chain name, e.g., "MyDapp Subgraph Unichain".

You'll land on your subgraph's page with all CLI commands visible on the right side.

<img src="/unichain/subgraph-commands.png" alt="Subgraph Commands" />

### Install the Graph CLI

```bash
npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli
```

### Initialize Your Local Subgraph

```bash
graph init <SUBGRAPH_SLUG>
```

You'll be prompted to provide information about your subgraph:

Simply verify your contract on the block explorer, and the CLI will
automatically obtain the ABI and set up your subgraph. The default settings will
generate an entity for each event.

## 2. Deploy and Publish

### Deploy to Subgraph Studio

First, run these commands:

```bash
$ graph codegen
$ graph build
```

Then, run these to authenticate and deploy your subgraph. You can copy these
commands directly from your subgraph's page in Studio to include your specific
deploy key and subgraph slug:

```bash
$ graph auth <DEPLOY_KEY>
$ graph deploy <SUBGRAPH_SLUG>
```

You will be asked for a version label. You can enter something like v0.0.1, but
you're free to choose the format.

### Test Your Subgraph

You can test your subgraph by making a sample query in the playground section.
The Details tab will show you an API endpoint. You can use that endpoint to test
from your dapp.

### Publish Your Subgraph to The Graph's Decentralized Network

Once your subgraph is ready to be put into production, you can publish it to the
decentralized network. On your subgraph's page in Subgraph Studio, click on the
Publish button:

<img src="/unichain/publish-subgraph.png" alt="Publish Subgraph" />

Before you can query your subgraph, Indexers need to begin serving queries on
it. In order to streamline this process, you can curate your own subgraph using
GRT.

When publishing, you'll see the option to curate your subgraph. As of May 2024,
it is recommended that you curate your own subgraph with at least 3,000 GRT to
ensure that it is indexed and available for querying as soon as possible.

> **Note:** The Graph's smart contracts are all on Arbitrum One, even though
> your subgraph is indexing data from Unichain
> [supported chain](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/developing/supported-networks/).

## 3. Query Your Subgraph

Congratulations! You can now query your subgraph on the decentralized network!

To query any subgraph on the decentralized network, pass a GraphQL query into
the subgraph's query URL, which can be found at the top of its Explorer page.

Here's an example from the
[CryptoPunks Ethereum subgraph](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraphs/HdVdERFUe8h61vm2fDyycHgxjsde5PbB832NHgJfZNqK)
by Messari:

<img src="/unichain/cryptopunk.png" alt="CryptoPunks Example" />

The query URL for this subgraph is:

```
https://gateway-arbitrum.network.thegraph.com/api/[api-key]/subgraphs/id/HdVdERFUe8h61vm2fDyycgxjsde5PbB832NHgJfZNqK
```

Now, you simply need to fill in your own API Key to start sending GraphQL
queries to this endpoint.

### Get Your Own API key

In Subgraph Studio, you'll see the "API Keys" menu at the top of the page. Here,
you can create API Keys.

## Appendix

### Sample Query

This query shows the most expensive CryptoPunks sold.

```graphql
{
  trades(orderBy: priceETH, orderDirection: desc) {
    priceETH
    tokenId
  }
}
```

Passing this into the query URL returns this result:

```
{
  "data": {
    "trades": [
      {
        "priceETH": "124457.067524886018255505",
        "tokenId": "9998"
      },
      {
        "priceETH": "8000",
        "tokenId": "5822"
      },
//      ...
```

### Sample Code

```jsx
const axios = require("axios");

const graphqlQuery = `{
  trades(orderBy: priceETH, orderDirection: desc) {
    priceETH
    tokenId
  }
}`;
const queryUrl =
  "https://gateway-arbitrum.network.thegraph.com/api/[api-key]/subgraphs/id/HdVdERFUe8h61vm2fDyycHgxjsde5PbB832NHgJfZNqK";

const graphQLRequest = {
  method: "post",
  url: queryUrl,
  data: {
    query: graphqlQuery,
  },
};

// Send the GraphQL query
axios(graphQLRequest)
  .then((response) => {
    // Handle the response here
    const data = response.data.data;
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Handle any errors
    console.error(error);
  });
```

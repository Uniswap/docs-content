## Access Liquidity

Indexing, simulating, and encoding swaps across the [many liquidity sources](https://www.unichain.org/explore) on Unichain can be challenging.

Tycho, built on Subtreams, gives you all simulation and execution logic for Unichain liquidity in a convenient open source library.

## Quickstart: Trade on Unichain Liquidity

Clone the [Tycho Simulation repository](https://github.com/propeller-heads/tycho-simulation); you'll find the [quickstart code](https://github.com/propeller-heads/tycho-simulation/blob/main/examples/quickstart/main.rs) there.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/propeller-heads/tycho-simulation.git && cd tycho-simulation
```

Then run:

```bash
export RPC_URL=https://unichain-rpc.publicnode.com
export TYCHO_URL=tycho-unichain-beta.propellerheads.xyz
export TYCHO_API_KEY=sampletoken
export PRIVATE_KEY=YOUR_TEST_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY
cargo run --release --example quickstart -- --sell-token "0x078D782b760474a361dDA0AF3839290b0EF57AD6" --buy-token "0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006" --sell-amount 10 --chain "unichain" --swapper-pk $PRIVATE_KEY
```

In the above example, you're selling 10 USDC for WETH, at the best price available across all Uniswap pools on Unichain (v2, v3, and v4).

## How it works

Tycho:

- Fetches all protocol states and finds all WETH/USDC Uniswap pools.
- Simulates a swap of 10 USDC to WETH on every pool.
- Encodes a swap for the pool that has the best price right now.
- If you approve, it automatically sets the right approval against the pool and executes your swap for you.

Example output:

```bash

If you develop a hook, lending market, stablecoin, or any protocol that needs to be accessible to professional routers, you can freely integrate with Tycho and receive orderflow from all solvers, fillers, and market makers.

To integrate your protocol, you can self-integrate by following the [integration guide](https://docs.propellerheads.xyz/tycho/for-dexs/protocol-integration) and submit a PR (requires Rust experience).

description: Learn how to deploy a smart contract on Unichain
---

This guide will walk you through the process of deploying a smart contract on the Unichain network.

## Requirements

> ETH on Unichain is required, see [Funding a Wallet](/docs/unichain/getting-started/get-funds-on-unichain)

1. The guide uses [foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh) for deployments. Install it by running:

    ```bash
    curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
    ```

    To verify the installation:
    ```bash
    forge --version
    ```

2. Add Unichain to your `foundry.toml`
    ```toml
    [rpc_endpoints]
    unichain = "https://sepolia.unichain.org"
    ```

## Steps to Deploy

Due to the EVM-equivalence of *Unichain*, foundry commands should work as expected. The major difference is the network URL. In most cases, using `--rpc-url unichain` is sufficient

### 1. Navigate to your smart contract project
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/project
    ```

### 2. Deploying a smart contract
    > Your private key should have ETH on the Unichain network. A transaction will be created, and requires a gas fee.
    ```bash
    forge create src/{YourContract}.sol:{ContractName} --rpc-url unichain --private-key {YourPrivateKey}
    ```

### 3. Contract Verification
    Obtain an API key from https://sepolia.uniscan.xyz

    There are two options to verify your contract:
    - During deployment
    - After deployment

    During deployment provide additional flags:
    ```bash
    --etherscan-api-key {API_KEY} --verify
    ```

    After deployment:
    ```bash
    forge verify-contract \
        --chain-id 1301 \
        --num-of-optimizations 200 \
        --watch \
        --constructor-args $(cast abi-encode "constructor(string,string,uint256,uint256)" "ForgeUSD" "FUSD" 18 1000000000000000000000) \
        --etherscan-api-key {your_etherscan_api_key} \
        --compiler-version {v0.8.20+commit.a1b79de}
        {the_contract_address} \
        src/{YourContract}.sol:{ContractName}
    ```

## Example Deployment

See [deploying an ERC-20 contract](/docs/unichain/building-on-unichain/deploy-an-erc20)

## Best Practices

* ### Verification
    Verifying during deployment is recommended, as compilation parameters are known during execution

* ### Scripting
    For complex deployments, such as deploying multiple related contracts, complex constructor arguments, or create & call patterns, it is recommended to use foundry's [solidity scripting](https://book.getfoundry.sh/tutorials/solidity-scripting)

## Difference Between Unichain and Ethereum Mainnet
As an OP Stack chain, Unichain is designed to be EVM equivalent with only minimal changes to the standard Ethereum Protocol. Read more about the differences between OP Stack chains and mainnet in the [OP Stack Docs](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/differences).

title: "Unichain Node Snapshots"
description: "Use snapshots to quickly bootstrap Unichain nodes without full blockchain sync"
---

Starting a new Unichain node from scratch requires a full blockchain sync, which can take 4-8 hours for mainnet and 2-4 hours for testnet. Using a snapshot significantly reduces this initial sync time to just a few minutes.

## Snapshot Sources

Allnodes provides regularly updated snapshots for both Unichain networks. Additionally, we host hourly differential updates for nodes that need to catch up quickly without downloading a full snapshot.

## Snapshot Restoration Process

These instructions assume you're working in the cloned unichain-node directory containing the docker-compose.yml file. You can find instructions on how to set up a node [here](/docs/unichain/getting-started/set-up-a-node) if you don't already have one running.

### 1. Prepare the Data Directory

Create the data directory that will store your blockchain data:

```bash
mkdir ./geth-data
```

For existing installations: If you've previously run the node, stop it first and clear the existing data:

```bash
docker compose down
rm -rf ./geth-data/*
```

### 2. Download the Snapshot

Visit the appropriate Allnodes link from the table above and download the snapshot for your target network.

**Important**: Ensure sufficient disk space is available. The compressed snapshot archive will expand to a significantly larger size when extracted.

### 3. Extract the Archive

Extract the downloaded snapshot file:

```bash
tar -xzvf <downloaded-snapshot-filename.tar.gz>
```

### 4. Organize the Data

The extraction process creates a directory structure (typically named geth). Move the contents to your prepared data directory:

```bash
mv ./geth/* ./geth-data/
rm -rf ./geth
```

**Expected result**: The ./geth-data/ directory should contain blockchain data folders (chaindata, nodes, etc.) directly, without additional nesting.

### 5. Start the Node

Launch your Unichain node with the restored data:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

### 6. Verify Operation

Monitor the node startup and sync process:

```bash
docker compose logs -f op-geth
```

The node should begin syncing from the snapshot's block height rather than genesis. Once operation is confirmed, the downloaded snapshot archive can be deleted to recover disk space.

## Incremental Updates with Hourly Diffs

For nodes that are already synchronized but have fallen behind, hourly differential files provide a more efficient update method than full snapshots. These smaller files contain only recent blockchain changes and can quickly bring a node current without the overhead of a complete snapshot download.

Download the appropriate hourly diff from the links above and apply it to your existing node data for faster synchronization.

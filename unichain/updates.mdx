## Live on Unichain: Flashblocks 200ms Sub-Blocks (08/14/2025)

Unichain now confirms transactions every 200 milliseconds, making it one of the fastest chains out there. But speed alone isn't enough.

This makes Unichain the first chain to pair sub-second latency with provable ordering — delivering the speed users expect and integrity developers can build on. It's Flashblocks as they were originally envisioned: fast, verifiable, and built for DeFi.

<Callout type="info">
Flashblocks on Unichain were designed by Uniswap Labs and Flashbots to run inside Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs).

## Live on Unichain: Fair Transaction Ordering and MEV Protection (05/01/2025)

Unichain is now the first L2 to build blocks inside a trusted execution environment (TEE) – this upgrade brings more transparency to block building, ensures priority ordering, mitigates extractive MEV, and introduces support for revert protection.

<Callout type="info">
Powered by <a href="https://writings.flashbots.net/introducing-rollup-boost" target="_">Rollup-Boost</a>, the TEE-based block builder on Unichain was built by Uniswap Labs and Flashbots. With this release, Unichain continues pushing toward faster, more decentralized infrastructure built for DeFi.

## Critical Upgrade for Unichain-Sepolia Nodes (03/15/2025)

OP Labs identified a bug affecting all OP Stack Sepolia chains (not Mainnet), causing temporary L1 fee overcharging.

This issue has been fixed in the latest [op-node release](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases/tag/op-node%2Fv1.12.0).

<Callout title="Action Required by March 20!" type="warn">
Please upgrade to:
<ul>
    <li>``op-node version v1.12.0``</li>
    <li>``op-geth version v1.101503.0``</li>
</ul>

If using the network flag ``--network=unichain-sepolia``, the upgrade activates automatically.

Otherwise, add this to your rollup.json: ``"pectra_blob_schedule_time": 1742486400``

**All node and chain operators must update before the Ethereum Pectra activation.**

## Permissionless Fault Proofs Update (12/18/2024)

On **Monday January 6, 2025**, Unichain Sepolia will undergo a scheduled upgrade to enable <a href="https://specs.optimism.io/fault-proof/index.html" target="_">permissionless fault proofs</a>. This is a critical milestone toward the full release of Unichain which will launch the mainnet launches as an open, trustless system.

<Callout title="Action Required: Re-Prove Pending Withdrawals!" type="warn">
We recommend not starting any new withdrawals within 7 days of the upgrade as withdrawls that are still pending the day of the upgrade must be restarted. For any that are still pending on January 6:
    <ul>
        <li>These withdrawals will NO LONGER process automatically.</li>
        <li>Once we confirm the upgrade has completed, users will need to re-prove these withdrawals. </li>
    </ul>
</Callout>

Thank you for being part of this journey! Together, we're building the future of decentralized trading on Unichain.

# Quick Start

This guide will help you make your first API request in minutes.

## Step 1: Get Your API Key

First, sign up for a developer account and create an API key in the [Developer Portal](/).

<Callout type="info">
  Keep your API key secure and never expose it in client-side code.
</Callout>

## Step 2: Make Your First Request

Once you have your API key, you can make your first request:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.uniswap.org/v1/quote" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## Step 3: Install the SDK (Optional)

For a better developer experience, install our official SDK:

```bash
npm install @uniswap/sdk
```

Then use it in your application:

```typescript
import { UniswapSDK } from '@uniswap/sdk'

const sdk = new UniswapSDK({
  apiKey: process.env.UNISWAP_API_KEY,
})

const quote = await sdk.quote({
  tokenIn: '0x...',
  tokenOut: '0x...',
  amount: '1000000000000000000',
})
```

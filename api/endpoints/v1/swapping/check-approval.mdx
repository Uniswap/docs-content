          Allows the requestor to check if the `walletAddress` has the required
          approval to transact the `token` up to the `amount` specified. If the
          `walletAddress` does not have the required approval, the response will
          include a transaction to approve the token spend. If the
          `walletAddress` has the required approval, the response will return
          the approval with a `null` value. If the parameter `includeGasInfo` is
          set to `true` and an approval is needed, then the response will
          include both the transaction and the gas fee for the approval
          transaction.


          Certain tokens may require that approval be reset before approving a
          new spend amount. If this condition is detected for the
          `walletAddress` and `token`, the response will include the necessary
          approval cancellation in the `cancel` paragraph. When `cancel` is not
          applicable, the paragraph will have a `null` value.

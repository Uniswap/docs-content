          Requests a quote according to the specified swap parameters. This
          endpoint may be used to get a quote for a swap, a bridge, or a
          wrap/unwrap. The resulting response includes a quote for the swap and
          the proposed route by which the quote was achieved. The response will
          also include estimated gas fees for the proposed quote route. If the
          proposed route is via a Uniswap Protocol pool, the response may
          include a permit2 message for the swapper to sign prior to making a
          /swap request. The proposed route will also be simulated. If the
          simulation fails, the response will include an error message or
          `txFailureReason`.


          Certain routing options may be whitelisted by the requestor through
          the use of the `protocols` field. Further, the requestor may ask for
          the best price route or for the fastest price route through the
          'routingPreference' field. Note that the fastest price route refers to
          the speed with which a quote is returned, not the number of
          transactions that may be required to get from the input token and
          chain to the output token and chain. Further note that all
          `routingPreference` values except for `FASTEST` and `BEST_PRICE` are
          deprecated. For more information on the `protocols` and
          `routingPreference` fields, see the [Token Trading
          Workflow](https://uniswap-docs.readme.io/reference/trading-flow#swap-routing)
          explanation of Swap Routing.


          API integrators using this API for the benefit of customer end users
          may request a service fee be taken from the output token and deposited
          to a fee collection address. To request this, please reach out to your
          Uniswap Labs contact. This optional fee is associated to the API key
          and is always taken from the output token. Note if there is a fee and
          the `type` is `EXACT_INPUT`, the output amount quoted will **not**
          include the fee subtraction. If there is a fee and the `type` is
          `EXACT_OUTPUT`, the input amount quoted will **not** include the fee
          addition. Instead, in both cases, the fee will be recorded in the
          `portionBips` and `portionAmount` fields.

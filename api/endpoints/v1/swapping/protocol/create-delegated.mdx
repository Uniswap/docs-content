          Create the EIP 7702 calldata for a swap transaction (including
          wrap/unwrap and bridging) against the Uniswap Protocols. If the
          `quote` parameter includes the fee parameters, then the calldata will
          include the fee disbursement. The gas estimates will be **more
          precise** when the the response calldata would be valid if submitted
          on-chain.

          The order endpoint is used to submit a UniswapX intent. If the
          `routing` field in the response to a quote is any of `DUTCH_V2`,
          `DUTCH_V3`, `LIMIT_ORDER`, or `PRIORITY` this endpoint is used to
          submit your order to the UniswapX protocol to be filled by the filler
          network. These orders are gasless because the filler will pay the gas
          to complete the transaction.


          The order will be validated and, if valid, will be submitted to the
          filler network. The network will try to fill the order at the quoted
          `startAmount`. If the order is not filled at the `startAmount` by the
          `deadline`, the amount will start decaying until the `endAmount` is
          reached. The order will remain `open` until it is either filled,
          canceled, or has expired by remaining unfilled beyond the
          `decayEndTime`.


          For simplicity, the order request is identical to the quote response
          except for the addition of the signed permit.

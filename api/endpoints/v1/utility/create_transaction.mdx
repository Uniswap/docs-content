          This endpoint will generate a calldata for a send transaction based on
          the inputs. The calldata may be signed by the `sender` to cause the
          specified `amount` of the `token` to be transfered from the `sender`
          to the `recipient`. The successful response always includes estimated
          gas for the transaction.

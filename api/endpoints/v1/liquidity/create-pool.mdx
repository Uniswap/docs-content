          This request allows the caller to create a position in a pool or, if
          the pool does not yet exist, to create a new pool. If a new pool must
          be created, a transaction is returned for the pool creation. In either
          case, a transaction is returned to create the new position in the
          pool. If the parameter `simulateTransaction` is set to true, then the
          response will include the gas fee for the creation transaction(s).


          Different fields are required depending on the pool version (V2, V3,
          or V4) into which a new position will be created, in addition to the
          fields which are always required. When creating a position in a V2
          pool, the `position` object must contain token0 and token1 addresses.
          When creating a position in a V3 pool, the `position` object must
          contain all fields except for `hooks` which are not supported in V3
          pools. When creating a position in a V4 pool, all fields within the
          `position` object are required except for `hooks` which is optional.
          Note that both V3 and V4 pools require the population of `tickLower`
          and `tickUpper` fields. Furthermore, `poolLiquidity`, `currentTick`,
          and `sqrtRatioX96` are always required when creating a position in a
          V3 or V4 pool. All pool versions require the population of `amount0`
          and `amount1`, which specify the quantity of tokens being entered into
          the pool.


          When creating a pool, additional fields are required depending on the
          pool version being created, in addition to the fields which are always
          required. When creating a V3 or V4 pool, either `initialPrice` or
          `poolLiquidity`, `currentTick`, and `sqrtRatioX96` are required. When
          creating a V2 pool, only `initialPrice` is required. V3 and V4 pools
          require `amount0` and `amount1` fields to be populated, as the
          creation of the pool must include seeding of liquidity. V2 pools may
          optionally have `amount0` and `amount1` populated; V2 pools do not
          require liquidity to be seeded when creating the pool.

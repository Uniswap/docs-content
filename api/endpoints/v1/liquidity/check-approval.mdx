          Checks if the wallet address has the required approvals. If the wallet
          address does not have the required approval, then the response will
          include the transactions to approve the tokens. If the wallet address
          has the required approval, then the response will be empty for the
          corresponding tokens. If the parameter `simulateTransaction` is set to
          `true`, then the response will include the gas fees for the approval
          transactions.


          Note that approval is required for both creating and removing
          positions in V2 pools. Approval is only required for creating
          positions in V3 and V4 pools.

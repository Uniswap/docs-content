description: Learn how to integrate token swaps on Uniswap, from smart contracts to REST APIs.
---

Token swaps are the core primitive of the Uniswap protocol. A swap trades one token for another using onchain liquidity pools, with prices determined by an automated market maker (AMM) rather than an order book.

Uniswap supports swaps on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Polygon, and other networks. Every swap is permissionless and executes atomically -- the caller either receives their output tokens or the transaction reverts.

## Choose your integration path

There are three ways to execute swaps, depending on your use case:

### Smart contracts

Build swap logic directly into your Solidity contracts using the Universal Router and Uniswap v4 PoolManager. This is the right path if you are building a protocol, aggregator, or any onchain system that needs to execute swaps programmatically.

### TypeScript SDK

Use the Uniswap SDK to build swap transactions from a JavaScript or TypeScript application. The SDK handles routing, quoting, and transaction encoding, so you can focus on your frontend or backend logic.

### Trading API (REST)

Call the Uniswap Trading API to get optimized swap quotes and calldata over HTTP. This is the fastest way to integrate if you want a simple request/response interface without managing routing logic yourself.

## How swaps work

Under the hood, every Uniswap swap interacts with one or more liquidity pools. Each pool holds reserves of two tokens and uses a pricing curve to determine exchange rates. When a user swaps token A for token B, they deposit token A into the pool and withdraw token B, with the price adjusting according to the constant product formula (v2) or concentrated liquidity curve (v3/v4).

For multi-hop swaps (e.g. A to B to C), a router contract chains the individual pool swaps together into a single atomic transaction.

Key concepts:
- **Slippage tolerance** -- the maximum acceptable price movement between quote and execution
- **Price impact** -- how much the swap itself moves the pool price, based on trade size relative to pool liquidity
- **Deadlines** -- a timestamp after which the transaction reverts, protecting against stale quotes

## Flash swaps

Uniswap also supports flash swaps, where you can withdraw tokens before paying for them, as long as the debt is settled within the same transaction. This enables capital-free arbitrage and other advanced patterns.

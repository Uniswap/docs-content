description: Learn how to provide liquidity on Uniswap, from creating pools to managing positions and filling UniswapX orders.
---

Liquidity providers (LPs) deposit tokens into Uniswap pools, enabling trading and earning fees in return. Uniswap v3 and v4 use concentrated liquidity, where LPs choose specific price ranges for their capital, improving capital efficiency compared to full-range positions.

Providing liquidity is permissionless -- anyone can create a pool, add liquidity, or adjust their position at any time.

## Choose your integration path

### Smart contracts

Build liquidity management directly into your Solidity contracts using the v4 PositionManager. This is the right approach for protocols, vaults, or automated liquidity managers that need onchain control over positions.

### TypeScript SDK

Use the Uniswap SDK to build, encode, and submit liquidity transactions from JavaScript or TypeScript. The SDK handles the complexity of encoding PositionManager actions and Permit2 approvals.

### Trading API (REST)

Use the Uniswap API to get liquidity position data and build transactions over HTTP, without managing routing or encoding logic yourself.

### UniswapX filling

Fillers are market makers who compete to execute user swaps at the best prices through UniswapX's permissionless auction system. If you have liquidity sources and want to fill orders rather than provide passive pool liquidity, this is your path.

## Key concepts

### Concentrated liquidity

Unlike v2 where liquidity is spread across the entire price curve (0 to infinity), v3 and v4 allow LPs to concentrate their capital within specific price ranges. A position that covers a narrower range earns more fees per unit of capital when the price is within that range, but earns nothing when the price moves outside it.

### Positions as NFTs

Liquidity positions in v3 and v4 are represented as ERC-721 tokens. Each position has a unique token ID and tracks the pool, tick range, liquidity amount, and accrued fees. Positions are managed through the PositionManager contract.

### Fees

LPs earn a share of swap fees proportional to their liquidity within the active price range. In v4, pools can also use dynamic fees controlled by hooks, allowing fee rates to adjust based on market conditions.

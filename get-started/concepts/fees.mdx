<Callout type="note">
While v3 uses predefined fee tiers (0.01%, 0.05%, 0.3%, and 1%), v4 introduces flexible fees that can range from 0% to 100%, offering greater customization options for pools.

## Swap Fees

Swap fees are distributed pro-rata to all in-range[^1] liquidity at the time of the swap. If the spot price moves out of a position’s range, the given liquidity is no longer active and does not generate any fees. If the spot price reverses and reenters the position’s range, the position’s liquidity becomes active again and will generate fees.

Swap fees are not automatically reinvested as they were in previous versions of Uniswap. Instead, they are collected separately from the pool and must be manually redeemed when the owner wishes to collect their fees.

## Pool Fees Tiers

Uniswap v3 introduces multiple pools for each token pair, each with a different swapping fee. Liquidity providers may initially create pools at three fee levels: 0.05%, 0.30%, and 1%. More fee levels may be added by UNI governance, e.g. the 0.01% fee level added by [this](https://vote.uniswapfoundation.org/proposals/9) governance proposal in December 2021, as executed [here](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5c84f89a67237db7500538b81af61ebd827c081302dd73a1c20c8f6efaaf4f3c).

Breaking pairs into separate pools was previously untenable due to the issue of liquidity fragmentation. Any incentive alignments achieved by more fee optionality invariably resulted in a net loss to traders, due to lower pairwise liquidity and the resulting increase in price impact upon swapping.

The introduction of concentrated liquidity decouples total liquidity from price impact. With price impact concerns out of the way, breaking pairs into multiple pools becomes a feasible approach to improving the functionality of a pool for assets previously underserved by the 0.30% swap fee.

## Finding The Right Pool Fee

We anticipate that certain types of assets will gravitate towards specific fee tiers, based on where the incentives for both swappers and liquidity providers come nearest to alignment.

We expect low volatility assets (stable coins) will likely congregate in the lowest fee tier, as the price risk for liquidity providers holding these assets is very low, and those swapping will be motivated to pursue an execution price closest to 1:1 as they can get.

Similarly, we anticipate more exotic assets, or those traded rarely, will naturally gravitate towards a higher fee - as liquidity providers will be motivated to offset the cost risk of holding these assets for the duration of their position.

## Protocol Fees

With the passage of the [UNIfication governance proposal](https://vote.uniswapfoundation.org/proposals/93) on December 25th, 2025, all v2 pools and certain v3 pools now have a protocol fee to programmatically burn UNI. Read more on [protocol fees](/docs/protocols/protocol-fee/overview) and [fee levels](/docs/protocols/protocol-fee/concepts/fees).

[^1]: In-range liquidity refers to the liquidity contained in any positions which span both sides of the spot price.

## Liquidity provider fees

There is a **0.3%** fee for swapping tokens. **This fee is split by liquidity providers proportional to their contribution to liquidity reserves.**

Swapping fees are immediately deposited into liquidity reserves. This increases the value of liquidity tokens, functioning as a payout to all liquidity providers proportional to their share of the pool. Fees are collected by burning liquidity tokens to remove a proportional share of the underlying reserves.

Since fees are added to liquidity pools, the invariant increases at the end of every trade. Within a single transaction, the invariant represents `token0_pool * token1_pool` at the end of the previous transaction.

There are many community-developed tools to determine returns. You can also read more in the docs about how to think about [LP returns](/docs/protocols/v2/concepts/understanding-returns).

## Protocol Fees

At the moment there are no protocol fees. However, it is possible for a 0.05% fee to be turned on in the future.

More information about a potential future protocol fee can be found [here](https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v2/#path-to-sustainability).

## Protocol Charge Calculation

In the future, it is possible that a protocol-wide charge of 0.05% per trade will take effect. This represents ⅙th (16.6̅%) of the 0.30% fee. The fee is in effect if [feeTo](/docs/protocols/v2/overview#feeto) is not `address(0)` (`0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`), indicating that feeTo is the recipient of the charge.

This amount would not affect the fee paid by traders, but would affect the amount received by liquidity providers.

Rather than calculating this charge on swaps, which would significantly increase gas costs for all users, the charge is instead calculated when liquidity is added or removed. See the <a href='/whitepaper.pdf' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>whitepaper</a> for more details.

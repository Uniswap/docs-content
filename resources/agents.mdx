description: AI-powered tools, plugins, and LLM context files to help you build on Uniswap faster.

Uniswap provides AI-powered development tools that help you integrate swaps, build v4 hooks, provide liquidity, and interact with the EVM — all from within your code editor. These tools work with AI coding agents like [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), [Cursor](https://cursor.com), [Windsurf](https://windsurf.com), and others.

## Uniswap AI Toolkit

The [Uniswap AI Toolkit](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-ai) is an open-source collection of plugins and skills that give AI coding agents deep knowledge of Uniswap protocols, APIs, and smart contracts. Instead of relying on general training data, these tools provide agents with up-to-date, protocol-specific guidance — including code patterns, security best practices, and deployment workflows.

### Available plugins

| Plugin | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **uniswap-trading** | Integrate Uniswap swaps via the Trading API, Universal Router SDK, or direct smart contract calls. Covers Permit2 patterns, ERC-4337 smart accounts, and multi-chain support. |
| **uniswap-hooks** | Security-first guidance for building Uniswap v4 hooks. Includes vulnerability patterns (NoOp attacks, delta accounting), permission flag risk matrices, and aggregator hook templates for routing through external DEX liquidity. |
| **uniswap-viem** | EVM blockchain integration using [viem](https://viem.sh) and [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh). Covers client setup, contract interactions, account management, and React hooks. |
| **uniswap-driver** | Discover tokens and plan Uniswap swaps or liquidity positions. Generates deep links that open directly in the Uniswap interface with parameters pre-filled. |
| **uniswap-cca** | Configure and deploy Continuous Clearing Auction (CCA) smart contracts for token distribution. Interactive configuration, validation, and Foundry deployment scripts. |

### Install with the Skills CLI

The toolkit is available through [skills.sh](https://skills.sh), a cross-platform CLI for installing AI agent skills:

```bash
npx skills add Uniswap/uniswap-ai
```

This works with any AI coding agent that supports skill files — not just Claude Code.

### Install as a Claude Code plugin

If you use [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), you can install the toolkit directly from the marketplace:

```bash
claude plugin add uniswap-hooks     # v4 hook development
claude plugin add uniswap-trading   # Swap integration
claude plugin add uniswap-viem      # EVM / viem / wagmi
claude plugin add uniswap-driver    # Token discovery & deep links
claude plugin add uniswap-cca       # CCA auction configuration
```

Once installed, the plugins activate automatically when relevant to your task. You can also invoke specific skills directly — for example, `/uniswap-hooks:v4-security-foundations` for a security-first walkthrough of hook development.

## LLM Context Files

If you prefer to give your AI agent raw documentation context rather than structured skills, Uniswap publishes LLM-optimized text files that summarize the protocol documentation.

### llms.txt and llms-full.txt

AI models have a context window — the amount of text they can process at once. Providing relevant documentation upfront helps the model give better answers without hallucinating.

Uniswap offers two context files:

- **[llms.txt](https://docs.uniswap.org/v4-llms.txt)** — A compact summary with links to documentation sections. Works well with most models (100K+ token context windows).
- **[llms-full.txt](https://docs.uniswap.org/v4-llms-full.txt)** — A verbose version with more inline content. Use this if your model has a larger context window or you want more detail without following links.

## Code Editor Setup

### Cursor

1. Navigate to **Cursor Settings > Features > Docs**
2. Select **Add new doc** and paste one of the following URLs:

```
https://docs.uniswap.org/v4-llms.txt
```

```
https://docs.uniswap.org/v4-llms-full.txt
```

3. Use `@docs` → **Uniswap** to reference the documentation in your chat.

### Windsurf

Windsurf requires referencing documentation in each conversation. Add it to the Cascade window (`CMD+L`):

```
@docs:https://docs.uniswap.org/v4-llms.txt
```

```
@docs:https://docs.uniswap.org/v4-llms-full.txt
```

### Claude Code

Install the Uniswap AI Toolkit plugins (see [above](#install-as-a-claude-code-plugin)) for the richest integration. The plugins provide structured skills, expert agents, and protocol-specific tools that go beyond static documentation context.

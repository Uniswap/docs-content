## The Uniswap Subgraph

Uniswap uses multiple [subgraphs](https://thegraph.com/docs/about/introduction#what-the-graph-is) for indexing and organizing data from the Uniswap smart contracts.
These subgraphs are hosted on The Graph and can be used to query Uniswap data.

### Versions and Production Endpoints

Each version of Uniswap for each chain has its own dedicated subgraph. As hosted subgraphs have been depreciated, you will now need to call through their decentralized subgraphs.

Each subgraph has a dedicated endpoint for querying data, as well as a page on [The Graph explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer) that exposes the schema and available fields to query.

## Creating an API Key

API Keys can be created by users inside the [Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/apikeys/). This key will be included into the endpoint to associate a consumers usage to their billing.

This section explains the Uniswap Subgraph and how to interact with it. The Uniswap subgraph indexes data from the Uniswap contracts over time. It organizes data about pairs, tokens, Uniswap as a whole, and more. The subgraph updates any time a transaction is made on Uniswap. The subgraph runs on [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) protocol's hosted service and can be openly queried.

## Resources

[Subgraph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer/profile/0xddaaed8b88ac0ccfdbfabdceba1c619391760f7f?view=Subgraphs&chain=arbitrum-one) - sandbox for querying data and endpoints for developers.

[Uniswap V2 Subgraph](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v2-subgraph) - source code for deployed subgraph.

## Usage

The subgraph provides a snapshot of the current state of Uniswap and also tracks historical data. It is currently used to power [uniswap.info](https://uniswap.info/). **It is not intended to be used as a data source for structuring transactions (contracts should be referenced directly for the most reliable live data).**

## Making Queries

To learn more about querying a subgraph refer to [The Graph's documentation](https://thegraph.com/docs/about/introduction).

## Versions

The [Uniswap V2 Subgraph](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraphs/A3Np3RQbaBA6oKJgiwDJeo5T3zrYfGHPWFYayMwtNDum?view=Query&chain=arbitrum-one) only tracks data on Uniswap V2. For Uniswap V1 information see the [V1 Subgraph](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraphs/ESnjgAG9NjfmHypk4Huu4PVvz55fUwpyrRqHF21thoLJ?view=Query&chain=arbitrum-one).

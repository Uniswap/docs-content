title: Process
---

This is a living document which represents the current process guidelines for developing and advancing Uniswap Governance Proposals. It was last updated September 2024.

## Tools

Uniswap Governance takes place in several venues. Each serves its own particular purpose.

1.  [_Governance Forum_](https://gov.uniswap.org/)

A Discourse-hosted forum for governance-related discussion. Community members must register for an account before sharing or liking posts. New members must read 4 topics and a combined 15 posts over the course of at least 10 minutes before they may  post themselves.

2. [_Snapshot_](https://snapshot.box/#/s:uniswapgovernance.eth)

A simple voting interface that allows users to signal sentiment off-chain. Votes on Snapshot are weighted by the number of UNI delegated to the address used to vote.

3. [_Uniswap Agora_](https://vote.uniswapfoundation.org)

The [Uniswap Foundation](https://www.uniswapfoundation.org) supports this voting and delegation interface. [Tally](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/uniswap) is another excellent app that supports proposal creation, delegation, and voting.


## Process

Below we outline the current Uniswap governance process, detailing where these venues fit in. These processes are subject to change according to feedback from the Uniswap community.

### Phase 1: Request for Comment (RFC)

_Timeframe_: At least 7 days

_Form_: [Governance Forum](https://gov.uniswap.org/) Post

As a proposer, you should use the RFC phase to introduce the community to your proposal. Your post should detail exactly what you are asking delegates to vote on as well as your rationale for why it is a good idea. You should be prepared to answer questions about your proposal. Willingness to adjust based on community feedback is a hallmark of successful past proposals.

To post a RFC, label your post “RFC - [Your Title Here]”. Prior to moving to Phase 2, give the community at least 7 days to read and comment on the RFC. Please respond to questions in the comments, and take feedback into account in the next iteration of the proposal posted in Phase 2.

### Phase 2: Temperature Check

_Timeframe_: 5 days

_Quorum_: 10M UNI

_Form_: [Snapshot Poll](https://snapshot.box/#/s:uniswapgovernance.eth)

The purpose of the Temperature Check is to signal community sentiment on a proposal prior to moving towards an onchain vote.

To create a Temperature Check:

1. Incorporate the community feedback from the RFC phase into the proposal.

2. Create and post this version of the proposal in the [Governance Forum](https://gov.uniswap.org/) with the title “Temperature Check — [Your Title Here]”. Include a link to the RFC post. You will update the post to include a link to the Snapshot poll after you’ve posted that.

3. Create a [Snapshot poll](https://snapshot.box/#/s:uniswapgovernance.eth). The voting options should consist of those which have gained support in the RFC Phase. This poll can be either binary or multiple choice but must include a `No change` option. Set the poll duration to 5 days. Include a link to the Forum Temperature Check post.

4. Update the Forum post with a link to the Snapshot Poll.

At the end of 5 days, the option with the majority of votes wins. There must be at least 10M UNI `Yes` votes to move onto Phase 3. If the “No change” option wins, the proposal will not move onto the Phase 3.

### Phase 3: Governance Proposal

_Timeframe_: 2 day waiting period, 7 day voting period, 2 day timelock

 _Threshold_: 1M UNI

_Quorum_: 40M UNI votes in favor

Form: [Governance Proposal](https://vote.uniswapfoundation.org/)

{/* ![](./images/Proposal_Flow.png) */}

Phase 3 is the final step of the governance process. If this vote passes, then a change will be enacted onchain.

To create an onchain Governance Proposal:

1. Incorporate any last iterations to your proposal based on feedback prior to posting.

2. Create a topic in the [Governance Forum](https://gov.uniswap.org/) titled "Governance Proposal — [Your Title Here]" and link to previous forum posts and the Temperature Check Snapshot poll.

3. Create your proposal. This can be done either through an interface (e.g. [Tally](https://tally.xyz/gov/uniswap)) or through writing the calldata for more complicated proposal logic. If the proposal passed, this calldata will execute. If writing the calldata yourself, please review the logic with a qualified Uniswap community member prior to posting the proposal.

4. Ensure that at least 1 million UNI is delegated to your address in order to submit a proposal, or find a delegate who has enough delegated UNI to meet the proposal threshold to propose on your behalf.

5. Once you submit the proposal, a two-day voting delay will start. After the voting delay finishes, a ~seven-day voting period begins. If the proposal passes, a two-day timelock must pass before you can execute the proposed code.

## Changes to the Governance Process

Timeframe: 7 days

_Quorum_: 40M UNI

Form: [Snapshot Poll](https://snapshot.box/#/s:uniswapgovernance.eth)

In the future, the community governance process above may need to undergo additional changes to continue to meet the needs of the Uniswap community. While an onchain vote is not required to change the majority of this process, a clear display of community support and acceptance is important for process changes to have legitimacy.

Thus, changes to all off-chain community governance processes should be voted on through an off-chain Snapshot vote. There should be a 7-day voting period and 40M UNI quorum.

The Uniswap protocol is governed and upgraded by UNI token holders, using three distinct components; the UNI token, governance module, and Timelock. Together, these contracts allow the community to propose, vote, and implement changes to the uniswap protocol.

Any addresses with more than 2.5M UNI delegated to it may propose governance actions, which contain finished, executable code. When a proposal is created, the community can cast their votes during a 3 day voting period. If a majority, and at least 4M votes are cast for the proposal, it is queued in the Timelock, and may be executed in a minimum of 2 days.

### Timelock

The Timelock contract can modify system parameters, logic, and contracts in a 'time-delayed, opt-out' upgrade pattern. Timelock has a hard-coded minimum delay of 2 days, which is the least amount of notice possible for a governance action. Each proposed action will be published at a minimum of 2 days in the future from the time of announcement. Major upgrades, such as changing the risk system, may have up to a 30 day delay. Timelock is controlled by the governance module; pending and completed governance actions can be monitored on the Timelock Dashboard.

### Delegate

```solidity
function delegate(address delegatee)
```

Delegate votes from the sender to the delegatee. Users can delegate to 1 address at a time, and the number of votes added to the delegatee’s vote count is equivalent to the balance of UNI in the user’s account. Votes are delegated from the current block and onward, until the sender delegates again, or transfers their UNI.

| Name      | Type      |                                                                    |

### Delegate By Signature

```solidity
function delegateBySig(address delegatee, uint nonce, uint expiry, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s)
```

Delegate votes from the sender to the delegatee. Users can delegate to 1 address at a time, and the number of votes added to the delegatee’s vote count is equivalent to the balance of UNI in the user’s account. Votes are delegated from the current block and onward, until the sender delegates again, or transfers their UNI.

| Name      | Type      |                                                                                                                     |

## State-Changing Functions: Governor Alpha

### Propose

```solidity
function propose(address[] memory targets, uint[] memory values, string[] memory signatures, bytes[] memory calldatas, string memory description) returns (uint)
```

Creates a Proposal to change the protocol.

Proposals will be voted on by delegated voters. If there is sufficient support before the voting period ends, the proposal shall be automatically enacted. Enacted proposals are queued and executed in the Timelock contract.

The sender must hold more UNI than the current proposal threshold (proposalThreshold()) as of the immediately previous block. The proposal can have up to 10 actions (based on proposalMaxOperations()).

The proposer cannot create another proposal if they currently have a pending or active proposal. It is not possible to queue two identical actions in the same block (due to a restriction in the Timelock), therefore actions in a single proposal must be unique, and unique proposals that share an identical action must be queued in different blocks.

| Name        | Type      |                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :---------- | :-------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| targets     | `address` | The ordered list of target addresses for calls to be made during proposal execution. This array must be the same length as all other array parameters in this function.                 |
| values      | `uint`    | The ordered list of values (i.e. msg.value) to be passed to the calls made during proposal execution. This array must be the same length as all other array parameters in this function |
| signatures  | `string`  | The ordered list of function signatures to be passed during execution. This array must be the same length as all other array parameters in this function.                               |
| calldatas   | `bytes`   | The ordered list of data to be passed to each individual function call during proposal execution. This array must be the same length as all other array parameters in this function.    |
| description | `string`  | A human readable description of the proposal and the changes it will enact.                                                                                                             |
|             |           |                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Unnamed     | `uint`    | Returns ID of the new proposal                                                                                                                                                          |

### Queue

```solidity
function queue(uint proposalId)
```

After a proposal has succeeded, any address can call the queue method to move the proposal into the Timelock queue. A proposal can only be queued if it has succeeded.

| Name       | Type   |                                   |
| :--------- | :----- | :-------------------------------- |
| proposalId | `uint` | ID of a given successful proposal |

### Execute

```solidity
function execute(uint proposalId) payable
```

After the Timelock delay period, any account may invoke the execute method to apply the changes from the proposal to the target contracts. This will invoke each of the actions described in the proposal.
This function is payable so the Timelock contract can invoke payable functions that were selected in the proposal.

| Name       | Type   |                                   |
| :--------- | :----- | :-------------------------------- |
| proposalId | `uint` | ID of a given successful proposal |

### Cancel

```solidity
function queue(uint proposalId)
```

Cancel a proposal that has not yet been executed. The Guardian is the only one who may execute this unless the proposer does not maintain the delegates required to create a proposal. If the proposer does not have more delegates than the proposal threshold, anyone can cancel the proposal.

| Name       | Type   |                            |
| :--------- | :----- | :------------------------- |
| proposalId | `uint` | ID of a proposal to cancel |

### Cast Vote

```solidity
function castVote(uint proposalId, bool support)
```

Cast a vote on a proposal. The account's voting weight is determined by it's number of delegated votes at the time the proposal becomes active.

| Name       | Type   |                                                                     |
| :--------- | :----- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| proposalId | `uint` | ID of a given successful proposal                                   |
| support    | `bool` | A boolean of true for 'yes' or false for 'no' on the proposal vote. |

### Cast Vote By Signature

```solidity
function castVoteBySig(uint proposalId, bool support, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s)
```

Cast a vote on a proposal. The account's voting weight is determined by its number of delegated votes at the time the proposal became active. This method has the same purpose as Cast Vote, but instead enables offline signatures to participate in governance voting. For more details on how to create an offline signature, review EIP-712.

| Name       | Type      |                                                                                         |
| :--------- | :-------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| proposalId | `uint`    | ID of a given successful proposal                                                       |
| support    | `bool`    | A boolean of true for 'yes' or false for 'no' on the proposal vote.                     |
| expiry     | `uint`    | The time when the signature expires. A block timestamp in seconds since the unix epoch. |
| v          | `uint`    | The recovery byte of the signature.                                                     |
| r          | `bytes32` | Half of the ECDSA signature pair.                                                       |
| s          | `bytes32` | Half of the ECDSA signature pair.                                                       |

The Uniswap protocol is governed and upgraded by UNI token holders, using three distinct components; the UNI token, governance module, and Timelock. Together, these contracts allow the community to propose, vote, and implement changes to the uniswap protocol.

Any addresses with more than 2.5M UNI (0.25% of total supply) delegated to it may propose governance actions, which contain finished, executable code. When a proposal is created, the community can cast their votes during a 7 day voting period. If there are more 'For' votes than 'Against' (i.e. a simple majority), and the number of 'For' votes >40M (meeting the quorum), it is queued in the Timelock, and may be executed in a minimum of 2 days.

## Timelock

The Timelock contract can modify system parameters, logic, and contracts in a 'time-delayed, opt-out' upgrade pattern. Timelock has a hard-coded minimum delay of 2 days, which is the least amount of notice possible for a governance action. Each proposed action will be published at a minimum of 2 days in the future from the time of announcement. Major upgrades, such as changing the risk system, may have up to a 30 day delay. Timelock is controlled by the governance module; pending and completed governance actions can be monitored on the Timelock Dashboard.

## State-Changing Functions: UNI

### Delegate

```solidity
function delegate(address delegatee)
```

Delegate votes from the sender to the delegatee. Users can delegate to 1 address at a time, and the number of votes added to the delegatee’s vote count is equivalent to the balance of UNI in the user’s account. Votes are delegated from the current block and onward, until the sender delegates again, or transfers their UNI.

| Name      | Type      |                                                                    |
| :-------- | :-------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| delegatee | `address` | The address to which msg.sender wishes to delegate their votes to. |

### Delegate By Signature

```solidity
function delegateBySig(address delegatee, uint nonce, uint expiry, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s)
```

Delegate votes from the sender to the delegatee. Users can delegate to 1 address at a time, and the number of votes added to the delegatee’s vote count is equivalent to the balance of UNI in the user’s account. Votes are delegated from the current block and onward, until the sender delegates again, or transfers their UNI.

### Propose

```solidity
function propose(address[] memory targets, uint[] memory values, string[] memory signatures, bytes[] memory calldatas, string memory description) returns (uint)
```

Creates a Proposal to change the protocol.

Proposals will be voted on by delegated voters. If there is sufficient support before the voting period ends, the proposal shall be automatically enacted. Enacted proposals are queued and executed in the Timelock contract.

The sender must hold more UNI than the current proposal threshold (proposalThreshold()) as of the immediately previous block. The proposal can have up to 10 actions (based on proposalMaxOperations()).

The proposer cannot create another proposal if they currently have a pending or active proposal. It is not possible to queue two identical actions in the same block (due to a restriction in the Timelock), therefore actions in a single proposal must be unique, and unique proposals that share an identical action must be queued in different blocks.

| Name        | Type      |                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| values      | `uint`    | The ordered list of values (i.e. msg.value) to be passed to the calls made during proposal execution. This array must be the same length as all other array parameters in this function |
| signatures  | `string`  | The ordered list of function signatures to be passed during execution. This array must be the same length as all other array parameters in this function.                               |

| Unnamed     | `uint`    | Returns ID of the new proposal                                                                                                                                                          |

### Queue

```solidity
function queue(uint proposalId)
```

After a proposal has succeeded, any address can call the queue method to move the proposal into the Timelock queue. A proposal can only be queued if it has succeeded.

| Name       | Type   |                                   |
| :--------- | :----- | :-------------------------------- |
| proposalId | `uint` | ID of a given successful proposal |

### Execute

```solidity
function execute(uint proposalId) payable
```

After the Timelock delay period, any account may invoke the execute method to apply the changes from the proposal to the target contracts. This will invoke each of the actions described in the proposal.
This function is payable so the Timelock contract can invoke payable functions that were selected in the proposal.

| Name       | Type   |                                   |
| :--------- | :----- | :-------------------------------- |
| proposalId | `uint` | ID of a given successful proposal |

### Cancel

```solidity
function cancel(uint proposalId)
```

Cancel a proposal that has not yet been executed. The Guardian is the only one who may execute this unless the proposer does not maintain the delegates required to create a proposal. If the proposer does not have more delegates than the proposal threshold, anyone can cancel the proposal.

| Name       | Type   |                            |
| :--------- | :----- | :------------------------- |
| proposalId | `uint` | ID of a proposal to cancel |

### Cast Vote

```solidity
function castVote(uint proposalId, bool support)
```

Cast a vote on a proposal. The account's voting weight is determined by it's number of delegated votes at the time the proposal becomes active.

| Name       | Type   |                                                                     |

| support    | `bool` | A boolean of true for 'yes' or false for 'no' on the proposal vote. |

### Cast Vote By Signature

```solidity
function castVoteBySig(uint proposalId, bool support, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s)
```

Cast a vote on a proposal. The account's voting weight is determined by its number of delegated votes at the time the proposal became active. This method has the same purpose as Cast Vote, but instead enables offline signatures to participate in governance voting. For more details on how to create an offline signature, review EIP-712.
